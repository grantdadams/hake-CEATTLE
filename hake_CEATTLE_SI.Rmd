![**SI Figure 1**: Temperature-dependent consumption rate function for Atlantic cod and pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the values used in the CEATTLE model for hake. Optimal and maximum temperatures for hake were derived from the temperatures recorded during the FEAT hake acoustic-trawl survey and for kriged, grided temperatures where hake were present.](./plots/bioenergetics/temp_consumption.png)

![**SI Figure 3**: Allometric mass function using values for Atlantic cod and juvenile and adult pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the values for hake from Francis (1983) where CA = 0.167 and CA / 2 = 0.0835.](./plots/bioenergetics/allometric_mass.png)

![**SI Figure 4**: Age vs. length from the hake assessment, the ages fitted to CCTD predators and prey using a von Bertalanffy growth curve parameterized with the length-at-age data from the hake survey (with bounds for ages of 1 and 15 for the CEATTLE models), and ages from FEAT acoustic-trawl survey data.](./plots/diet/growth_curve.png)
