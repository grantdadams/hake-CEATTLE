![**SI Figure 1**: Temperature-dependent consumption rate function using values for Atlantic cod and pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the estimates for hake. Optimal and maximum temperatures for hake are modelled for the entire acoustic survey area and for kriged, grided temperatures where hake were present.](./plots/bioenergetics/temp_consumption.png)
