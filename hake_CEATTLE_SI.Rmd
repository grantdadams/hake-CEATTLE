![**SI Figure 1**: Allometric mass function using values for Atlantic cod and juvenile and adult pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the values for hake from Francis (1983) where CA = 0.167 and CA/2 = 0.0835.](./plots/bioenergetics/allometric_mass.png)

![**SI Figure 2**: Temperature-dependent consumption rate function using values for Atlantic cod and pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the estimates for hake. Optimal and maximum temperatures for hake are modelled for the entire acoustic survey area and for kriged, grided temperatures where hake were present.](./plots/bioenergetics/temp_consumption.png)
