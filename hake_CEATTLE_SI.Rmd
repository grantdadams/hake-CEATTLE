![**Figure S.1**: Suitability coefficient (suitability of consumpiton and preferred age of prey) derived from the observed proportion of prey-at-age in the stomachs of predators-at-age for CEATTLE model with cannibalism.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/suitability.png)

![**Figure S.2**: Temperature-dependent consumption rate function for Atlantic cod and pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the values used in the CEATTLE model for hake. Optimal and maximum temperatures for hake were derived from the temperatures recorded during the FEAT hake acoustic-trawl survey and for kriged, grided temperatures where hake were present.](./plots/bioenergetics/temp_consumption.png)

 ![**Figure S.3**: Yearly mean kriged temperatures weighted by hake biomass estimate by grid (for survey years), mean survey temperatures, and mean ROMS temperature for the entire time-series (1980-2020).](./plots/temperature/mean_temp_compared.png)

![**Figure S.4**: Allometric mass function using values for Atlantic cod and juvenile and adult pollock from Fish Bioenergetics 4 and the values for hake from Francis (1983) where CA = 0.167 and CA / 2 = 0.0835.](./plots/bioenergetics/allometric_mass.png)

![**Figure S.5**: Age vs. length from the hake assessment, the ages fitted to CCTD predators and prey using a von Bertalanffy growth curve parameterized with the length-at-age data from the hake survey (with bounds for ages of 1 and 15 for the CEATTLE models), and ages from FEAT acoustic-trawl survey data.](./plots/diet/growth_curve.png)

![**Figure S.6**: Dirichlet-reweighted output for the calculation of mean diet proportion from all records of hake depredation by predator age (box) and prey age (column). Black bars represent 95% confidence intervals.](./plots/diet/Dirichlet/Dirichlet_all_years.png)

 ![**Figure S.7**: Scaled diet proportion by predator age for sensitivity testing, with observed diet ration scaled to a maximum of 0.5%, 10%, 50%, and 75% cannibalism by weight.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/Testing/sensitivity_prop.png)
