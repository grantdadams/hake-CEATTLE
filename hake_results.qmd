![**Figure 2**: Dirichlet-weighted diet proportions by weight of cannibalism by predator and prey age age for three periods: all years in the dataset (1988-2019), the period of high observed cannibalism (1991–1999), and the period of low observed cannibalism (2005–2019).](./plots/diet/Dirichlet/Dirichlet_comp_pretty.png)

![**Figure 3**: Spawning biomass (Mt), total biomass (Mt), and age-1 recruitment (millions) with 95% confidence intervals (shaded region) for Pacific hake from CEATTLE in single-species mode, in cannibalism mode with the average proportion of cannibalism for the entire period, and from the 2020 stock assessment; relative spawning biomass (SB), SB/SB~0~, for the CEATTLE single-species and cannibalism models. The vertical line represents the start of the forecast period (2020). Horizontal lines represent SB~0~ (1.0), the management target (0.4), and the minimum stock size threshold (0.1). ](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/popdyn_M1prior.png)

The horizontal line represents the age at 50% maturity (2.5) for Pacific hake from the 2020 stock assessment. The vertical line represents the start of the forecast period.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/biom_n_byage.png)

![**Figure 5**: Spawning biomass (Mt), Total biomass (Mt), recruitment (millions) with 95% confidence interval (shaded region) for models testing the sensitivity to the diet proportion: using base cannibalism data and the base data scaled to a maximum cannibalism proportion by weight of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 0.75; for models testing varying periods of cannibalism: using the diet data for the period of high observed cannibalism (1980-1999) and the period of low cannibalism (2005-2019). The time-series for the varying periods of cannibalism are displayed only for that period. The vertical line represents the start of the forecast period.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/Testing/ALL_sens_popdy.png)

![**Figure 6**: Change in the total negative log likelihood (NLL) and likelihood components for the single-species and cannibalism CEATTLE models with fixed values of M1. Age = survey and fishery age composition data NLL, F = fishing mortality deviates penalty, Init = initial abundance deviates penalty, Rec = recruitment deviates penalty, Sel = selectivity deviates penalty, Survey = survey index NLL. Horizontal line is at the threshold for significant improvements in likelihood.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/Testing/M1/M1_comp_profile.png)
