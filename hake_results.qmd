![**Figure 1**: Dirichlet-weighted diet proportions of cannibalism in hake stomachs by weight, by predator and prey age age for three periods: all years in the dataset, the period of high observed cannibalism (1991–1999), and the period of low observed cannibalism (2005–2019).](./plots/diet/Dirichlet/Dirichlet_comp_pretty.png)

![**Figure 3**: Spawning biomass (Mt), total biomass (Mt), and age-1 recruitment (millions) with 95% confidence intervals (shaded region) for Pacific hake from CEATTLE in single-species mode with no predation, from CEATTLE in cannibalism mode with the average diet data for the entire period, and from the 2020 stock assessment; relative spawning biomass (SB), SB/SB0, for the CEATTLE single-species and cannibalism models. Horizontal lines represent SB0 (1.0), the management target (0.4) and minimum stock size threshold (0.1). The vertical, dashed line represents the end of the hindcast (2019) and start of the 3-year forecast period for the 2020 assessment.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/popdyn_M1prior.png)

![**Figure 4**: Difference in numbers-at-age for the 2020 stock assessment, subtracted from the CEATTLE model with the average cannibalism data. The horizontal line represents the age at 50% maturity (2.5) for Pacific hake from the 2020 stock assessment. The vertical line represents the end of the hindcast (2019) for the 2020 assessment.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/nbyage_anomaly.png)

![**Figure 5**: Spawning biomass (Mt), Total biomass (Mt), recruitment (millions) with 95% confidence interval (shaded region) for models testing the sensitivity to the diet proportion: using base cannibalism data and the base data scaled to varying proportions (0.5% to 75%), and for varying periods of cannibalism: using the diet data for the period of high observed cannibalism (1980-1999) and the period of low cannibalism (2005-2019). The vertical line represents the end of the hindcast (2019) for the 2020 assessment.](./plots/CEATTLE/cannibalism/Testing/ALL_sens_popdy.png)
