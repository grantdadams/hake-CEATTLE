## Summary

CEATTLE - Climate-Enhanced, Age-based model with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics - is a multi-species, age-structured assessment model that has been used for groundfish in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. This project seeks to apply CEATTLE to Pacific hake in the California Current Ecosystem. Pacific hake are an important fishery on the US West Coast (\$60 million in 2017), and are one of the most abundant predators. This implementation of CEATTLE focuses on hake cannibalism.

## Data sources

CEATTLE is implemented through the [RCeattle](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle) package, a wrapper for the model built in Template Model Builder (TMB). The model incorporates data from multiple sources: primarily the [hake stock assessment](https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment) conducted by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), with the climate and trophic linkeages integrated through temperature-specific bioenergetics and predation (diet) data.

### Hake assessment

The data inputs into CEATTLE include survey and fishery catch data, length and age composition, and empirical weight-at-age. These data are from the [hake assessment](https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment). A summary of the data are below.

### Temperature

Temperature data are available from the acoustic survey for hake for 13 years between 1995-2019. The temperature is reported for 100m, or bottom temp if the bottom was <100m, and were collected with a variety of instruments. 

![Temperature at ~100m for the entire survey area.](./plots/temperature/temp_dist_all.png)

Calculation of the temperature-dependent consumption rate for both the climate and predation aspects of the model depends on finding an optimal and maximum temperature for hake. With no clear values in the literature to use for Pacific hake, the temperature where hake occurred during the survey can be used as an estimate.

The temperature across the survey had been kriged and used to create a spatial grid across the survey area. The temperature from this grid was then assigned to hake biomass estimates ([Malick et al. 2020](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p185-197/)) and filtered for when hake were present (biomass > 0).

Further temperature datasets are needed to provide an estimate for earlier and missing years. In CEATTLE, any missing years will be coded as the mean temperature.

### Bioenergetics

The climate and trophic linkeages in CEATTLE are driven by two consumption functions - allometric mass and temperature-dependent consumption. The estimates for allometric mass for hake come from [Francis (1983)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/f83-223), with the relationship $C = CA * weight ^ {CB}$, where $CA$ is the consumption by a 1g fish at optimal temperature and $CB$ is the allometric scaling coefficient of consumption (per gram of predator) with predator weight. The estimates for $CA$ and $CB$ from [Francis (1983)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/f83-223) (0.167; -0.460) are very similar to those used by Adams et al. (in prep) for pollock. [Francis (1983)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/f83-223) also notes that the estimated value of $CA = 0.167$ resulted from modeling the feeding-growing season, equated to 1.1-0.7% body weight consumed per day. [Francis (1983)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/f83-223) notes that annual values would be approximately half this: 0.4-0.5% body weight per day, corresponding to $CA = 0.0835$.

Following [Holsman et al. (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064515002751?casa_token=p_GOXy4_a04AAAAA:0k6yddGRTvDMkO-8gjvmltiZAkt-oS7BF_vCCq9q_hgldetgGY6HHiJB3LDCvxqTe9mErK68gSg) and Adams et al. (in prep), hake consumption is modeled as dependent on temperature and body size, following [Kitchell et al. (1977)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f77-258?journalCode=jfrbc). Temperature-dependent consumption is summarized as: 

$F(T) = V^X * e^{X(1 - V)}$

where:

$V = (TCM - T) / (TCM - TCO)$ 

$X - (Z^2 * (1 + (1 + 40 / Y)^{0.5})^2) / 400$ 

$Z = ln(CQ) * (TCM - TCO)$ 

$Y = ln(CQ) * (TCM - TCO + 2)$

$T$ is the temperature experienced by the hake and $TCM$ and $TCO$ are the maximum and optimal temperatures. $CQ$ represents the effect of temperature on consumption rate and would typically be derived from laboratory weight- and temperature-specific consumption experiments, which are lacking for Pacific hake. For comparison, in Holsman et al. (2016), the CEATTLE model for pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder relies on laboratory-derived bioenergetics parameters [(Holsman and Aydin 2005)](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2015/521/m521p217.pdf), which are available for these or related species. Without such studies for hake or other Merluccidae, we assume $CQ = 2.5$, slightly lower than for pollock and near the value for other species in Gadiformes, as summarized by [DesLauriers et al. (2017) in the Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 R package](http://fishbioenergetics.org/). Our value for CQ is also consistent with the global metanalyses of the related $Q_{10}$ parameter [(Dell et al. 2011)](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/26/10591).

$TCM$ and $TCO$, the maximum and optimal temperatures, have not been empirically derived from laboratory studies on hake, but have been approximated based on occurrence of Pacific hake, matched to the kriged, gridded temperatures from the acoustic survey ([Malick et al. 2020](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p185-197/)). Using this estimate of temperature when hake were present resulted in the same median temperature (8°C) and a lower maximum temperature (10.5°C, compared to 14.5°C).

(in prep), and the estimates for hake. Optimal and maximum temperatures for hake are modeled for the entire acoustic survey area and for kriged, grided temperatures assigned to hake biomass > 0.](./plots/bioenergetics/temp_consumption.png)


### Predation (diet)

This implementation of the CEATTLE model focuses on hake cannibalism, assumed across the literature to form a significant portion of the Pacific hake diet [(Ressler et al. 2007)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Marine_Fisheries_Review/Fh2EDlfePrcC?hl=en&gbpv=1). Stomachs gathered from the hake survey, however, do not show a high rate of cannibalism. The dataset includes only 16 instances of hake cannibalism out of 3995 hake stomachs collected from 2005-2019, a rate of 0.4%.

![Pacific hake stomachs collected during the hake survey from 2005-2019, overall and with hake as a prey item.](./plots/diet/stomachs_per_year.png)

Looking at other sources of hake diet data, the cannibalism rate varies broadly from no cannibalism detected to over 80% of hake stomachs including hake as prey. These data are largely from adult hake. The one study that included juvenile hake found a cannibalism rate of 4.44%. The variability in cannibalism may be due to changes in the spatial overlap between adults and juveniles (as intra-cohort cannibalism is not generally detected - supported by the size disparity in predator and prey hake in the acoustic dataset) [(Ressler et al. 2007)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Marine_Fisheries_Review/Fh2EDlfePrcC?hl=en&gbpv=1).
