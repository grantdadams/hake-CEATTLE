## Pacific Hake diet

The occurence of intraspecific predation in Pacific hake diet appears to be highly variable, in contrast to previous estimates that intraspecific predation forms a significant portion of the Pacific hake diet - up t0 30% (CITE). Stomachs gathered from the hake acoustic trawl survey, however do not show a high rate of intraspecific predation with only 16 instances of cannibalism out of 3995 stomachs collected from 2005-2019: a rate of 0.4%. In earlier studies of hake stomach contents (WHICH STUDIES), there is a higher occurrence of cannibalism (Figure 1). 

![*Figure 1: Contents of hake stomachs collected from 1980-2020, containing Pacific hake (in green) or only other food items (in purple).*](./plots/diet/hake_cannibalism.png)

Overall, intraspecific predation makes up less than 30% of the Pacific hake diet by weight, but this percentage is highly variable both by year and by hake age. During the 1990s, the proportion of prey hake in predator hake stomachs by weight was over 75%, while for the recent data from 2005-2019, the percentage by weight was less than 10% (Fig. 2). Intraspecific predation also makes up a larger proportion of the diet of older hake and the majority of prey hake are age 1 or younger, with some records of hake depredation up to age 5 (Fig. 2).

The timing and location of the intraspecific predation is also variable, with some evidence in some years of perhaps a higher occurrence of cannibalism in at the southern end of the sampling area (below approximately 42Â°N) and later in the year. This potential trend is visible in 1998 and 1999 and without the potential geographic bias in 1995 and 1997 (Fig. 3). It is important to note, however, that there is the potential for significant sampling bias.

While the different sampling protocols and varying temporal and geographic coverage make it difficult to compare the rates of intraspecific predation across the timeseries, it does appear that more cannibalism was detected in the 1990s. Whether this trend is due to sampling or to an actual change in hake diet is still unclear. Incidentally, there is evidence of a similar trend in the proportion of hake present in the diets of California sea lions, with higher rates of hake depredation detected in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 2000s onwards (Fig. 4). The sea lion diet dataset consists of scat records from San Clemente and San Nicholas Islands in Southern California and has much more even coverage for the timeseries. The sea lion data were also collected quarterly, with some evidence that more hake were recorded in their diet in the Spring and Fall, especially in the earlier years (Fig. 4). These data can maybe serve as corroboration of some change in Pacific hake population dynamics manifesting in their depredation by both sea lion and their conspecifics.

## Applying intraspecific predation to CEATTLE

Without diet data (operating as a single-species model), the CEATTLE model matches well with the Stock Synthesis 3.0 (SS3) estimates for spawning stock biomass (SSB), total biomass, and recruitment for the timeseries (Fig. 5). When the mean rates of intraspecific predation (i.e. the rates for all years as in Fig. 2) are included, there is not an appreciable change in SSB, with a slight overall decrease in the estimate. For total biomass, the model run with cannibalism deviates more widely from both the single-species CEATTLE model and the SS3 runs. For recruitment, the number of individuals is much higher for the CEATTLE run with cannibalism as the model "creates" recruits to satisfy the higher rates of predation on year 1 hake (Fig 5.)

![*Figure 5: Spawning stock biomass (mt), total biomass (mt), and recruitment (n) for Pacific hake from CEATTLE run in single-species mode with no predation, with the estimate of mean cannibalism, and the Stock Synthesis 3.0 run from the 2020 stock assessment.*](./plots/CEATTLE/intraspecies predation/intrasp_popdy.png)

The predation pressure on the youngest hake in the model is incorporated through predation mortality (M2), which is added to the residual mortality (M1) and fishing mortality (F) to determine the total mortality coefficient used to calculate numbers at age per year of the model. M1 is taken from the hake assessment and is set to 0.23 for the first age (age 1) and 0.214 for the subsequent ages. When the model is run with intraspecific predation, the predation mortality on the age 1 hake increases dramatically, but there is little effect on the mortality of any other age group (Fig. 6)..

$N_{sp,a+1,y+1} = N_{sp,a,y} e^{-Zsp,a,y}$

$Z_{sp,a,y} = M1_{sp,a} + M2_{sp,a,y} + F_{sp,a,y}$

$sp = species$

$a = age$

$y = year$

![*Figure 6: Residual (M1) and predation (M2) mortality by age and year for CEATTLE run with the estimate of mean cannibalism.*](./plots/CEATTLE/intraspecies predation/M_intrasp.png)

The result of this excess mortality of the youngest hake is also apparent in the numbers-at-age, with a large increase in the number of are 1 hake estimated for the CEATTLE run with cannibalism, compared to the single-species model and the SS3 estimates (Fig. 6). The numbers-at-age are also highly variable across the timeseries (Fig. 6), with the largest increases in are 1 hake in the CEATTLE model with intraspecific predation occurring in 1981 and 1985, corresponding to the peaks visible in the estimates for total biomass and number of recruits (Fig. 5).

### Sensitivity testing

The overall mean proportion of intraspecific predation in the Pacific hake diet potentially belies the impact of cannibalism on hake population dynamics. To explore the effects of differing levels of cannibalism in CEATTLE on population dynamics, the model was fit with varying levels of intraspecific predation between 0.5 and 80% of predator hake diets by weight consisting of year 1 prey hake. Generally, with increasing intraspecific predation, the amount of individuals "created" by the model increases, with the estimates for biomass and recruitment for the stomach contents data relatively similar to an overall rate of 10% intraspecific predation by weight (Fig. 7). 

![*Figure 8: Runs of CEATTLE with varying levels of intraspecies predation (0.5% to 80%) and the mean cannibalism by weight from the Pacific hake stomach contents datasets.*](./plots/CEATTLE/intraspecies predation/Testing/test_intrasp_popdy.png)

To look at the amount of variability within the stomach contents datasets, CEATTLE was also run with the Dirichlet-reweighted estimates of mean intraspecific predation for the period of high cannibalism in the 1990s and the lower levels from the acoustic trawl survey.
